This paper adopted a multi-objective optimization approach, integrating LCA with TEA, to systematically analyze the relationship between the economic and environmental performance of PV-battery systems at manufacturing facilities. For this purpose, under the inspiration of the ReCiPe life cycle assessment method, information from several sources was compiled and adapted to quantify the different environmental impacts of the manufacturing facility’s energy consumption in the sizing formulation. The other objective function is formulated as the total cost of energy consumption, including the installation, operation, and maintenance cost of the PV-battery system and the cost of energy purchased from the grid. A case study of a PV-battery system at a typical lithium-battery assembly manufacturing facility is presented, with the facility’s energy consumption under a high throughput target simulated as the load profile. The results highlight the trade-offs between minimizing the costs and the environmental impacts of the facility’s energy consumption. It is also found that only considering the environmental impacts during the operation stage can cause underestimation of the impacts and lead to a selection of a more polluting PV-battery sizing configuration. This result further justifies the necessity of considering LCA in the PV-battery sizing problems.
