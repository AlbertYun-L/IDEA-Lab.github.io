The widespread deployment of smart meters and communication technologies brings opportunities to improve the adaptability and flexibility of future manufacturing systems under growing complexity and uncertainty. As a result, data-driven approaches, especially Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, are gaining wide attention in recent years. Although in the current literature, RL approaches show superiority over traditional methods in many applications, a comprehensive review and comparison of different RL methods and their use in discrete manufacturing system control under changing environments have not yet been established. This paper first provides a literature review of RL algorithms for decision-making in discrete manufacturing systems, and then systematically discusses the underlying mechanisms of four most commonly used RL algorithms. In addition, the performance of these RL algorithms is compared by solving a production control problem, which aims to maximize the profit under time-varying production costs. The comparison results show that the single-agent RL methods with discrete action space can provide satisfactory results in small-scale systems, while multi-agent RL algorithms are more suitable to solve problems in complex, large-scale systems to remit the curse of dimensionality. This research sheds light on the impacts of RL method selection on the search for high-quality solutions in manufacturing systems, which is envisioned to drive future research on RL-supported manufacturing systems.
