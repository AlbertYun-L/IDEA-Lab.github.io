We are excited to welcome Isaac Oladipupo to the IDEA Lab at UNC Charlotte. Isaac is pursuing his M.S. in the Engineering Management program and will undertake his capstone project on data-driven prediction in reverse supply chains. We are excited to see the contributions he will make through this important line of work.
