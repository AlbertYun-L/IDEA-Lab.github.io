We are excited to welcome Md Ariful Islam and Shree Raut to the IDEA Lab at UNC Charlotte. They will be pursuing their PhD studies in Industrial and Systems Engineering, contributing to our research on AI-driven manufacturing systems and energy management. We look forward to the innovative ideas and energy they will bring to our team.
